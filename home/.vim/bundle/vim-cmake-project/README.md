VIM-CMake-Project v0.3.0
===============

About
=====

CMake-Project is a plugin for cmake projects effective management.

This is a fork of https://github.com/Ignotus/vim-cmake-project 
The intention was to provide minor changes, but I ended up with complete rewrite of the project. It
depends on others (optional) plugins, like NERDTree and Vimux.  

vim-cmake-project has following features:

1. Project is activated only by opening cmake project file: "CMakeLists.txt". Project file "CMakeLists.txt" do not have
   to be in the current working directory. I.e "vim ~/prg/cplus/test/CMakeLists.txt". All above described commands will
   be available for the use.
2. Project provides two additional windows: 
    a) project files on the sidebar (using NEDRTree plugin). Project files are filtered, so it only C++/C files and txt 
    files will be shown. 
    b) output window - bottom window pane (using Vimux plugin). It will display output by executing commands.
3. Commands for building makefiles, compiling project, cleaning generated binaries and toggling project windows/panes.
4. Customizable mapping keys/shorcuts

Installing
==========

Install NERDTree and Vimux plugins (optional):

https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree

https://github.com/benmills/vimux

Install vim-cmake-project.
If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing pathogen.vim, and then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/sigidagi/vim-cmake-project.git

Or for Vundle users:

Add Plugin 'sigidagi/vim-cmake-project' to your ~/.vimrc and then:

    either within Vim: :PluginInstall
    or in your shell: vim +PluginInstall +qall

Usage
=====
Open "cmake" project file "CMakeLists.txt" with vim. CMake project file not necessary have to be
in current working directory. 

You can generate native makefiles and workspaces by this command:

    :CMakeBuild

Compile project 

    :CMakeCompile

Clean project - remove binary files generated by cmake

    :CMakeClean

If project is running on "tmux" all outputs are provided in separate
window/pane. Output window will open as soon as above commands are executed.
To close output window use following command:

    :CMakeOutput

To toggle sidebar window with project files issue following command:

    :CMakeBar

For navigation and usage of tree list in sidebar window refer to "NERDTree" plugin help


Default key maping:

    map <Leader>pb <Plug>CMakeBuild
    map <Leader>pc <Plug>CMakeCompile
    map <Leader>pl <Plug>CMakeClean
